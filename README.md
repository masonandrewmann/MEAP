# Mason's ESP32 Audio Prototyping System

MEAP is a hardware and software environment for developing live computer music systems and rapidly prototyping digital electronic instruments.

MEAP's audio library is build as an expansion on top of [Mozzi](https://sensorium.github.io/Mozzi/), implementing extra features that take advantage of the computational power of the ESP32-S3 and improve/simplify the composer's experience.
